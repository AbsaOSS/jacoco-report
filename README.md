## How to build

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbsaOSS/jacoco-report.git
cd jacoco-report
```

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running Unit Tests
Unit tests are written using pytest. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

This will execute all tests located in the __tests__ directory and generate a code coverage report.

## Code Coverage
Code coverage is collected using pytest-cov coverage tool. To run the tests and collect coverage information, use the following command:

```bash
pytest --cov=jacoco_report --cov-report html tests/
```
See the coverage report on the path:
```bash
htmlcov/index.html
```

## Run Action Locally
Create *.sh file and place it in the project root.
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set environment variables based on the action inputs
export INPUT_TODO="TODO"

# Run the Python script
python3 ./jacoco_report/todo.py
```
